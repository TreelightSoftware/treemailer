# Contributing

We welcome pull requests for everything, from documentation, tests, features, and comments. We are very new-contributor friendly and if we don't accept your request, we will
try to provide helpful feedback, bandwidth permitted. We value openness, diversity, and respect.

First, fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:TreelightSoftware/treemailer.git

Set up the app using the README steps. Please make sure all tests pass and that any new features include relevant tests. Not sure how to write tests? No problem, just ask and we can try our best to help you!

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
